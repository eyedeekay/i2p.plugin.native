ShellService Plugin Generator
=============================

Generates a valid ShellService plugin from a single script or executable. A ShellService plugin is an application which runs as a process which is managed by the I2P sofware. This allows I2P to manage the lifetime of a non-JVM application by monitoring it. That way, plugins don't risk outliving the I2P router because the router loses track of them.

A ShellService plugin should not "daemonize" itself or othewise fork itself to the background. The I2P router will manage it as a "Client Application" and daemonizing it will break this. If your process forks itself to the background by default, it must have this feature disabled to work as a ShellService.

ShellService adds additional "arguments" to the applications in question, which are used to configure the ShellService. In order to function correctly, the ShellService must be named so that the name of the Plugin, i.e. name in plugin.config, must match the -shellservice.name argument added by the ShellService class. If it does not, the ShellService will be unable to look up the plugin process. If the final elements of the ShellService name are -$OS-$ARCH or -$OS they may be optionally omitted.
